		   Hello, it's me<br>
		   I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
		   To go over everything<br>
		   They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br>
		   But I ain't done much healing<br>
		   <br><br>
		   Hello, can you hear me<br>
		   I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
		   When we were younger and free<br>
		   I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br>
		   There's such a difference between us<br>
		   And a million miles<br>
		   Hello from the other side<br>
